# World-Volcano-Data

This project was an attempt to explore the location and different types of volconos in the world.

The data for this project was extracted using web scraping library "BeautifulSoup" & "requests" from the website of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA).
Data source - https://rb.gy/utmee5

The geographical map for this project was made using the library "folium".

The data points are colored according to the elevation of that volcano. Color for the corresponding elevation can be refered through the map legend which is added using the "branca" library.

Some data entries for type of volcano are misspelled, which are corrected in the code.

Layer control feature is added to select/deselect the different types of volcanos like "shield volcano","strato volcano",etc.
